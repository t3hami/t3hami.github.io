&lt;h3 id="git"&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a crucial part of every developer’s life. We have come across from the cumbersome and hectic usage of bad old days versioning practice to a centralized and easy to collaborate process with git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the versioning became easier and collaboration is on our fingertips, there comes the issue of authenticity of the work contributed by individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-donkey-in-lions-skin"&gt;The Donkey in Lion’s Skin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have heard the The Donkey in Lion’s Skin story. The TLDR is a donkey dressed itself in a lion’s skin. Wherever the donkey went, the other animals and villagers feared him. The villagers and other animals thought that he was a real lion. After some time he became bold. Finally one day some people heard him braying. The people ran after him with sticks, and beat him to death. Hence, the poor donkey paid the price for his foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
