&lt;p&gt;Automatic scaling, is a cloud computing strategy that dynamically modifies the amount of computational resources required for an application. Normally measured by the number of active servers based on the load on the farm. For example, the number of servers hosting a web application can automatically increase or decrease based on the number of active users on your site. Because such metrics can fluctuate substantially during the day, and servers are a limited resource that cost money to run even when inactive, there is often an incentive to run “just enough” servers to support the current demand while still being able to handle sudden and large surges in activity. Autoscaling is useful for such situations because it may reduce the number of active servers when activity is low, and it can also increase the number of active servers when activity is high.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
